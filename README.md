# Visualizing-and-Predicting-improvement-of-NBA-players
 NBA (National Basketball Academy) is the most popular basketball league in the world.  With teams competing heavily in order to succeed, the most essential factor in determining whether  team wins the title is the performance of its players. The compensation of players is mostly determined  by their previous performance. Player performance, on the other hand, varies from season to season.  This paper focuses on visualizing the attributes that impact players improvement and predicting players  improvement for next season. We built various regression and classification models in order to achieve the task and compared their performance.
